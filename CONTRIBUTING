General guidelines for patches:

* Keep lines to approximatly 80 characters or less.  This is to allow git to do patches at the line level.
* No embedded HTML.  We need to render to LaTeX (and then PDF), which won't support it.


Submitting Patches

* Fork this repo on GitHub and send pull requests
* Find me on #sinatra and get a git-format-patch to me.
